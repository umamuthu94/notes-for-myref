Today, I planned how to use microservices in Spring Boot, and yesterday, I tried JDBC in Spring Boot. The example had an error, so I tried to recover from it. Additionally, I planned how to connect a simple H2 database.

morning session i listen how to run microservice in sevice discovery application and what are the steps i do and how to it works

-- I implemented a @GetMapping method to fetch EmpDetails by ID, using @RequestParam to get the ID from the URL and then calling the appropriate service method.

-- I have already written a Java Spring Boot RESTful controller to handle create, read, update, and delete operations on employee data. Now, I am implementing an Employee Management System with an HTML form to enter employee details.

-- I studied some basic concepts of JavaScript in order to connect to the employee management system.

microservices are collection of independent services communicate through api's.

today i go through to learn microservice how to work internally and  

I have implemented a Spring REST controller for employee operations, including saving, updating, and listing employees. Additionally, I integrated with another microservice to fetch company details using RestTemplate.

yesterday i have a error on jdbc in spring boot with using jdbc templete so i today i recover the error.

--  I implemented a @GetMapping method to fetch EmpDetails by Name, using @RequestParam to get the Name from the URL and then calling the appropriate service method and also I tried the code includes two Spring @GetMapping methods that retrieve lists of employee details starting with "Bala" and "R" respectively, using corresponding service methods. Each method is mapped to a specific URL ("/findByNameStartingWithBala" and "/findByNameStartingWithR") to handle HTTP GET requests.

-- I have a task to create a Spring Boot application to manage employee records with CRUD operations. Additionally, I need to integrate a frontend page to interact with the application.
