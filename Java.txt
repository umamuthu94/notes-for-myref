Java - run commends : compile : java c classname.java || run : java classname



1. datatypes : primitive: int, float, byte, double, long, shorts, char, boolean
		non: string, array, class.

2. how to run java : programe -->  byte cote --> jvm --> machine code ---> output

Jvm : Java vertual machine
JRE : JVM + classLiberaries
JDK : JRE + debuggers + documents + compilers


3. class - templete for object for ex: blueprint of home
   object - instance of class ex: actual home


 
4. oops -
encapsulation - data hiding, attributes declared private, and then getter - read the value, setter is defined - set the value.
ex: private long bank customer no;

//getter
public long getbank customer no() {
return bank customer no;
}

//setter
public void setbank customer no(long newcusno)
{
this.bank customer no=newcusno;
}



5. abstraction - data hiding and show only essestial details: abstract class and abstract method  : extend  ; ex: car : gear,starring,color but inside the functionalities hiding

   interface : implements : multilevel support : method declaration only 


6. inheritance : parent child class : child class accuring the parent class details : code reusabilty : extend
single
hirarical
multilevel


multiple


polymorphism
 constructor :
method overloading : same name, same class but differnt arguments
method overriding  : same name, same arguments but differnt class

exception handling-1.using try catch block
				
				try
				   {
				     //risky code
				   }
                                catch(exception name ref)
				   {
				      //alternate code 
				   }

Multithread :
 - Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads execute independently within a single process, enabling concurrent execution of tasks to improve performance and responsiveness.

Map:

-  map (also known as a dictionary or associative array) is an abstract data type that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and the values can be accessed, inserted, or deleted based on their associated keys.

Hashmap:

- HashMap is a data structure in Java that stores key-value pairs and allows fast retrieval and insertion operations based on the keys. It uses a hash table to efficiently map keys to their corresponding values.


enum:
- Enum is a Java data type that represents a fixed set of constants, providing a way to define and work with a predefined list of named values.

Lists:

- Lists are linear data structures in computer science that store a collection of elements in a specific order, allowing efficient access, insertion, and removal operations.

itration :
- Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a set of instructions or accessing elements in a data structure, usually in a loop, to perform a specific task or operation.

iteration vs lists:

- Iteration is a process of repeatedly performing a set of instructions, while a list is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a specific order. Iteration is a method of accessing elements in a list or any other data structure
